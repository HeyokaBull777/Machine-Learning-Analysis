#### Modeling via Machine Learning

#Several machine learning models were built to predict credit risk using data you'd typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification system, i.e. the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans, hence the need for several models. The imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries were used to evaluate models using the following two techniques: Resampling and Ensemble-Learning.
